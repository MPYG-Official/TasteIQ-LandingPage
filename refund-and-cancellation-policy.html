Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made 1 days of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or the service is out for delivery.

In case of unsatisfactory service, please report to our customer service team. The request would be entertained once the seller/ merchant listed on the Platform, has checked and determined the same at its own end. This should be reported within 1 days of receipt of services. In case you feel that the service received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 1 days of receiving the service. The customer service team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision. 

In case of complaints regarding the services that come with a warranty from the manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. 

In case of any refunds approved by TasteIQ, it will take 7 days for the refund to be processed to you.
